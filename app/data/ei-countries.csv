AUS,Australia,,"821, 326",images/flag-australia.png,"Mining companies – and many of the largest miners are Australian companies – that don’t respect human rights or protect the environment hinder, rather than help, development efforts.  ","<p>Many of the world’s mining giants call Australia home. Australia has profited from a global mining boom that has seen the industry increase its activities both here and overseas. More and more, the Australian mining industry is active in countries where corruption is plentiful and conflict is an ever-present risk. Mining companies that don’t respect human rights or protect the environment may cause harm to the communities living around their operations. Too often it’s the most marginalized — women and indigenous people — who are worst affected.</p>

<p>Without appropriate regulations and controls, and company commitments to human rights and sustainability, mining can cause people to lose their land and way of life while irreparably damaging the environment and exacerbating the risks of violent conflict. What’s more, without a commitment to transparency, the taxes that mining companies pay to governments may not be used for essential services like schools and hospitals.</p>

<p>But it doesn’t have to be this way.</p> ","<p>Our <a href=""https://www.oxfam.org.au/explore/mining/"">Mining and Advocacy program</a> works to influence the policies and practices of Australian mining, oil, and gas companies, the Australian government and multilateral institutions that support extractive industries.</p> 

<p>We take a rights-based approach to our work. This means that our advocacy efforts seek to ensure that mining respects the rights defined under the international human rights system, including the right of indigenous peoples and local community members to determine their development and to give or withhold free, prior and informed consent to mining activities. The Mining Advocacy program also works with affected communities to support them to understand their rights and corporate accountability mechanisms available to them that can hold companies accountable for their practices. </p>

BFA,Burkina Faso,,"476, 213",images/flag-burkina.png,The expansion of gold mining in Burkina Faso – making it the 4th largest gold producer in Africa – has proceeded faster than mining reforms. ,"<p>For many, gold mining is seen as a way for Burkina Faso to overcome its history of systemic poverty and inequality. Between 2007 and 2010, the number of foreign owned large-scale gold mines operating in the country increased, making Burkina Faso the 4th largest gold producer in Africa. </p>

<p>In light of mining’s new importance, Burkina Faso committed to disclose mining payments and revenues by joining the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). While revenues from industrial mining, in the form of royalties and income taxes, have increased since the opening of the first gold mine in 2007, they still remain absurdly low.</p>

<p>Currently a new mining code is being prepared with input from the IMF to attract more investment in mining and maximize government revenues while simultaneously protecting human and environmental rights – a promise that is easier said than done. For a start, citizens are asking mining companies to pay more to the communities where they are mining gold so that these profits can be invested in services and infrastructure.</p>","<p>Oxfam has worked in Burkina Faso for more than 30 years. In partnership with local organizations we support mining affected communities to engage effectively – and without fear of retribution – with government and mining companies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raise awareness through human rights advocacy and capacity building so that communities have a good understanding of their rights and are able to claim them;</li>
<li>Secure public access to mining contract and revenue information;</li> 
<li>Increase local engagement in expenditure monitoring and pro-poor budget decision making;</li>
<li>Increase local involvement and effectiveness in regulatory reforms to Burkina Faso’s mining laws to ensure consistency with the ECOWAS mining development policy, the Africa Mining Vision and international human rights law, and achieve full implementation by the government and EI companies;</li>
<li>Increase access to information on how resource revenues are spent at each level of government to ensure governments have the financial capacities to fulfill their responsibilities.</li>

SLV,El Salvador,,"249, 209",images/flag-elsalvador.png,El Salvador’s citizens are pushing for a national ban on mining because of human rights and environmental concerns – but the national debate has stalled since foreign company Pacific Rim (now OceanaGold) sued the government for millions for not granting a mining permit.,"<p>Clean water is one of the most serious livelihood challenges facing El Salvador’s roughly 6 million citizens, many of whom rely on agriculture. It is estimated that 90% of the surface water in El Salvador is contaminated, causing serious concerns about the risk of water pollution from mining – something the country has already seen in the San Sebastian River.  </p>

<p>Following successful campaigning by civil society, led by La Mesa Nacional Frente a la Minería (The National Roundtable on Metallic Mining) and supported by Oxfam, the government of El Salvador issued a moratorium on metallic mining in 2009. La Mesa, together with important allies such as the Catholic Church and the Attorney General for Human Rights, is currently advocating for a permanent ban on hard-rock metal mining in El Salvador. </p>  

<p>This reform has stalled following the decision by Pacific Rim – a subsidiary of Australian-Canadian parent company OceanaGold – to sue El Salvador for refusing to issue it licenses to exploit the gold and silver in the province of Cabañas despite failing to meet the legal requirements required for a permit. The Cabañas area is part of the Lempa River Basin, which provides fresh water for more than two-thirds of the country.</p>","<p>Oxfam has worked in El Salvador since 1993.

Increased gold production – which saw Ghana regain its 2010 position as the eighth leading gold producer in the world – and the discovery and drilling of crude oil from the Jubilee Field, coupled with extractive industry tax reforms, have boosted Ghana’s extractive industry revenue flows.</p>

<p>In 2012, mining profits reached a massive $5.44 billion – an amount that dwarfed official development aid to Ghana. However, only 15.32% of this (roughly $830 million) was government revenue. Alongside the discovery of oil came some of the most extensive accountability and transparency rules, and a regulation to prioritize local jobs in oil and gas projects – but these have yet to include full contract disclosure or apply to Ghana’s mining sector.</p>","<p>Oxfam has worked in Ghana for almost 30 years.

MWI,Malawi,,"568, 289",images/flag-malawi.png,"The voices, needs and interests of ordinary Malawian women, men, and young people must not be sidelined in the rush to extract mineral, oil, and gas resources.","<p>Malawi’s mining, oil, and gas potential is attracting significant interest. The opening of the Australian-operated Kayelekera uranium mine in 2009 – the single largest foreign direct investment in the country – and the real possibility of massive oil and gas reserves buried below Lake Malawi presents big potential opportunities and challenges. </p>

<p>Malawi is a low income country and relies heavily on external assistance. The majority of Malawians are subsistence farmers living in rural areas with extremely limited and uneven access to basic health and social services. Meanwhile, mining is known to undermine the rights of women. Oil and gas production in Lake Malawi risks the livelihoods of the 2 million people who rely on the lake for food, income, and water. Questions about the governance and accountability of the sector need to be addressed – especially regarding who makes decisions on tax regimes, royalties, issuance of licenses, and the use of proceeds from the sector.</p>","<p>Oxfam has worked in Malawi for more than 20 years. In response to local needs, Oxfam is developing an Extractive Industry program that aims to protect mining affected communities, ensure transparency of mining revenues, and monitor potential new oil developments. </p>

<p>We are working to:
<ul>
<li>Explore the actual contribution that mining makes to basic service provision, through the lens of women’s rights;</li>
<li>Strengthen revenue transparency and accountability through a rights-based framework that is based on communities’ right to decide the nature and extent of mining, oil, and gas development;</li>
<li>Support capacity building within government and civil society to address the challenges posed by the new importance of mining, oil, and gas; and</li>
<li>Foster greater collaboration across civil society to ensure meaningful accountability across the extractive industry value chain.</li>

MLI,Mali,,"472, 203",images/flag-mali.png,"Most Malians rely upon agriculture, grazing, artisanal small-scale mining, and hunting for their livelihoods – only a handful benefit from gold despite Mali being Africa’s third largest gold producer.","<p>Gold, and its trade, has a long history in Mali. Large-scale gold mining grew rapidly after the economic restructuring of the early 1990s and Mali is now Africa’s third largest producer. The sector was restructured to create a favorable investment environment for foreign mining companies, while simultaneously limiting the state’s ownership and oversight of the sector. Yet the majority of Malians reap few benefits from gold. Most Malians rely upon agriculture, grazing, artisanal small-scale mining, and hunting for their livelihoods. The onset of large-scale corporate mining deteriorates their sources of livelihood.</p> 

<p>Since then, Mali’s mining laws have undergone revisions as the government has attempted to reclaim oversight and increase its control over mining revenues. However, the complexities of Mali’s mining laws – and the lack of transparency with regard to mining revenues – make it difficult for citizens to be involved in the decision-making process and the management of mining revenues, and to understand the concrete implications of mining reforms and take action.</p>","<p>Oxfam has worked in Mali for more than 30 years. In partnership with local organizations, we support mining affected communities to engage effectively with government and mining companies and influence mining policy reforms.  Our program focuses on:
<ul>
<li>Securing public access to contract and revenue information;</li> 
<li>Increasing local engagement in expenditure monitoring and pro-poor budget decision making;</li>
<li>Raising awareness through human rights advocacy and capacity building so that communities have a good understanding of their rights and are able to claim them;</li>
<li>Increasing civil society involvement and effectiveness in regulatory reforms to Mali’s mining code to ensure it is consistent with the ECOWAS mining development policy, the Africa Mining Vision, and international human rights law, and that it is fully implemented by the government and companies; and</li>
<li>Increasing access to information on how resource revenues are spent at each level of government to ensure governments have the financial capacities to fulfill their accountability responsibilities.</li>

PNG,Papua New Guinea,,"855, 268",images/flag-png.png,Papua New Guinea relies heavily on the financial revenue generated by its natural resources and expectations are high that the current natural gas boom will deliver real development.,"<p>Papua New Guinea relies heavily on the financial revenue generated by its natural resources. Yet despite successive mining ‘booms,’ revenues have failed to translate into meaningful development outcomes or broadly shared benefits. In fact, mining projects have triggered serious instances of social unrest (and violence, particularly against women) and legacies of environmental harm remain.</p>

<p>Today the vast natural gas deposits in Papua’s southern highlands are the focus of the current boom. The PNG liquefied natural gas project is the largest gas development project in the country and is expected to double GDP, triple export revenues and net the national government somewhere between $7.5 and $11.7 billion over the next 30 years.</p>

<p>Expectations are high that this boom will actually deliver real development outcomes – and for the highland communities where the gas is located, where literacy levels are low and childhood and maternal mortality rates are high, the stakes are enormous.</p>","<p>In the context of the present natural gas boom, coupled with PNG’s legacies of mining conflict, violence, and environmental harm, Oxfam supports community and civil society initiatives that aim to ensure benefits from the gas boom are enjoyed by all Papua New Guineans, particularly women, and that any negative impacts are avoided or minimized. </p>

<p>Oxfam, together with local civil society and community-based organizations, facilitated a community-based participatory “listening project.” The objectives of were to:
<ul>
<li>Develop an understanding of the potential positive and negative impacts of the natural gas project by documenting communities’ experiences and views of these impacts;</li>
<li>Generate dialogue between communities and project decision-makers;</li>
<li>Produce a report describing how the PNG LNG Project is perceived to be affecting the communities, in order to help these and other communities engage with project decision-makers in managing expectations, and positive and negative impacts; and</li> 
<li>Underpin potential further work for project partners.</li>

Its extractive sector is set to grow quickly – with gold production to double and the recent discovery of oil. But so far, mining revenues have not helped most Senegalese: roughly three quarters of the population still suffers from inequality in health and education.</p>

<p>Important gains have been made to improve extractive industry revenue transparency in Senegal. With the government taking steps to decentralize decision-making and budgeting for health and schooling, transparency also needs to devolve to ensure that local budgets are properly funded, and spending meets local needs. Yet transparency alone is not enough: Senegal’s laws and institutions governing how and where mining takes place and ensuring it is accountable to citizens are weak or nonexistent and still do not take into account the needs of rural farming and fishing communities, or women and girls.</p>","<p>Oxfam has worked in Senegal since the early 1990s.
